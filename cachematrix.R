## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
# The makeCacheMatrix creates a special matrix object that can cache its inverse.
# cacheSolve computes the inverse of this matrix (if already has been calculated, taken from cache)

# This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}

# This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by 
# makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the 
# matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from 
# the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        
        inverse <- solve(x)
}
